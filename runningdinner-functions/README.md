# Overview

Contains a quite simple lambda for geocoding addresses, that is invoked by SQS events which are sent from backend application.

## Prerequisites

* SQS needs to be setup in front
* SSM (Parameter Store) is used to get hold of the Google Maps API Key and must be setup in front

## Run locally

``./start-local.sh``

* Serverless offline plugin is used for being able to run the lambda locally
* It provides also a local SQS queue which is backed by Localstack
* The parameter store (SSM) is also provided by Localstack 

See the scripts in runningdinner-infrastructure/local for more information. There is also a convenience script for adding a
Google Maps Key to the local SSM Parameter Store.

## Running the Tests

The test is quite a full integration test for performing a real geocoding operation.
It needs therefore a Google Maps Key provided by Localstack.<br/>
Furthermore we need to overwrite the SSM parameter store endpoint to Localstack by setting the env-var:
`AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_OVERWRITE = http://localhost:4566`

## Esbuild
For minifying the packaged Javascript code the esbuild-plugin is used which seems to work also with the latest Nodejs 18x version.

## Deploy

We have 2 stages to deploy to: dev and prod

* ``./deploy.sh dev``
* ``./deploy.sh prod``
